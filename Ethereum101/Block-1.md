# Ethereum - Blockchain,Next-generation,Smart Contracts, Decentralized Application Platform

## [1] Turing Complete
   - Turing-complete Programming language
   - Smart Contracts -> Decentralized Applications
   - State -> Rule -> State
   - Any State/Rule -> Any Application

## [2] Infrastructure 
   - Open Source Protocol & code
   - Blockchain -> state store & synchronize
   - Ether -> native currency Meter & Constrain
   - World Computer 
  
## [3] Properties
   - PermissionLess Apps Built-in Economics
   - High Availability, High Auditability
   - High Transparency Neutrality (All Transaction are open to everyone and all the contracts) 
   - Censorship Resistant Lower Counter-party Risk (very hard to taken anything down because this is Decentralized (There are many finance thing are happening so this is needed))

## [4] Purpose
   - Not Currency, Not Payments Network
   - ether -> Operation Necessary & Integral
   - Utility Token
   - Use -> Ethereum, Pay -> ether

## [5] Vs Bitcoin Scripts
   - Scripts -> Limited, Scripting Language
   - Scripts -> true/false, Spending Conditions
   - EVM -> general-purpose Programming Language
   - Turing Complete Arbitrary code/Complexity
   - Bitcoin Blockchain bitcoin -> OwnerShip
   - Bitcoin UTX0 Transfer -> Transition
   - Ethereum Blockchain General-purpose State
   - Ethereum Account/balance State -> Transition

## [6] Core Components
   - P2P Network TCP Pork 30303: DEVp2p
   - Transaction: sender,recipient,value,data
   - State Machine -> EVM (HLL(solidity) -> bytecode)
   - Data Structure -> Merkle Patricia Tree
